# amazon-clone
This Amazon clone is a simplified replica of the e-commerce giant's homepage, built using HTML and CSS. The project aims to recreate the basic layout and design elements of the original page, providing a foundation for further development. The clone features a clean and responsive design, with a navigation bar, search bar, and main content section. The HTML structure utilizes semantic elements, following modern web development standards. CSS is used to style the layout, colors, and typography, closely matching the original page's aesthetic. This project serves as a starting point for those looking to build upon the design and add functionality, or for those interested in learning HTML and CSS by reverse-engineering a well-known webpage.
